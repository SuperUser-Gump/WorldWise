# WorldWise - A React app to helps you track your travels and create a visual record of your adventures

This project is a part of [The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann). The website's design and structure were provided as part of the course curriculum, and I did not design the website from scratch. The primary purpose of this project is to practice and apply the concepts learned during the course.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://worldwise-krittin-saenpakdi.netlify.app/).

## Description

WorldWise helps you track your travels and create a visual record of your adventures. It allows you to add cities to your list and view them on a world map, as well as view information about each city.

It is built using [React.js](https://react.dev/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [React DatePicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/), [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/), [React Error Boundary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary), [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) and [BigDataCloud Client Side Reverse Geocoding to City API](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/free-api/free-reverse-geocode-to-city-api).

This application is currently in development, but it is already a useful tool for travelers. It is easy to use and has a clean and modern user interface.

**Features**

* **Pages:** WorldWise has 5 pages: homepage, pricing, product, login, and app.
* **Responsive design** WorldWise has a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
* **Interactive world map:** WorldWise displays a world map with markers for all of the cities that the user has added to their list.
* **City list:** WorldWise displays a list of all of the cities that the user has added to their list. The list includes the city name, country flag, and date of visit.
* **City form:** When the user clicks on a city on the map or in the list, WorldWise displays a form with information about the city, including the city name, country flag, date of visit, and notes about the trip.
